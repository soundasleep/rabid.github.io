## Content guidelines

This is representative of Rabid, so it's important to keep this at a relatively high standard of professionalism. Some general guidelines:

* Be your brilliant self
* Get someone else to read over your post for spelling and grammatical errors before posting
* Keep things positive and constructive. Go ahead and be critical of technologies, coffee filters etc, but don't be mean to people.
* Please don't swear. 
* Keep out of politics. If it's borderline, it's probably better to go on your personal blog. 
* Other than that anything is fair game. It's probably best to be at least vaguely related to something that at least one other person at Rabid would be interested to read.
